## The mission

It's time to fool around a little! You will be assigned a partner to be working with, starting with HTML and CSS. First you both will make a page about eachother with only HTML and CSS. In the must have features you'll find exactly what things you have to include.

Of course, you might not be sure what you should fill in for this person, this is where you take a guess. The fun part comes when you show them your finished HTML / CSS page. Now, it's time for them to correct and enhance your page using Javascript!

Since I had to do my practical exam for my drivers permit, I missed half a day. So I will do my ultimate best to catch up. A little side note, finally at the age of 32 I passed and got my drivers permit. I'm very ecstatic, especially because when I arrived at the examination center for the driver's license, it started of with an 'Oei, oei,..'.
Apparently my practical drivers permit was still valid, but my theoretical permit was expired. So I had to retake my theoretical exam again. At first look I thought, FUDGE! But hey everything worked out and I did the theoretical exam again without studying and passed.
