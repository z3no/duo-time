I mean there is a reason why people love cats, just look around youtube and type in cat videos. They just make my day, especially when they can help me coding when they put on their pink wig.</p>

Running around like Naruto and his friends, but doing it as fast as possible behind news reporters. It gives me a kick and keeps my stamina up. Who said smoking effects your stamina sure isn't doing my sport.</p>

I've seen all his movies and know all his catchphrases like "WHOA", in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, he says it 27 times. He is the kindest person I know, I even played League with him a few weeks ago and he let me win.</p>
